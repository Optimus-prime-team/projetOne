Cadre de gestion RH à l'Autorité de la concurrence
Send InMail
Autorité administrative indépendante, l’Autorité de la concurrence veille au bon fonctionnement concurrentiel de l’économie en France. Elle contribue à la régulation de la concurrence aux niveaux européen et international. Sa compétence transversale la conduit à intervenir dans tous les secteurs économiques.
 Elle a en charge 4 grandes missions :
 Lutter contre les pratiques anticoncurrentielles (ententes et abus)
Contrôler les opérations de concentrations (fusions et rachats)
Emettre des recommandations (avis aux pouvoirs publics et acteurs économiques)
Réguler les professions réglementées
 Classée dans la catégorie « Elite » (la 1ère) depuis 7 ans dans le classement de la Global Competition Review, l’Autorité est également en pointe sur les nouvelles problématiques liées à l’économie numérique.

ENVIRONNEMENT DU POSTE

La numérisation accélérée de l’économie induit des transformations profondes : émergence de plateformes bénéficiant d’effets de réseau considérables, bouleversement de la distribution physique par la vente en ligne, innovations technologiques apportées par l’intelligence artificielle et la science des données… Tous ces phénomènes bouleversent les règles du jeu concurrentiel et créent de nouveaux enjeux pour l’Autorité de la concurrence, qui a décidé de créer un service de l’économie numérique, qui sera placé au cœur des services d’instruction de l’Autorité et interviendra de façon transversale, comme le font aujourd’hui le service économique et le service des investigations.
 Les services d'instruction, dirigés par le rapporteur général, comptent environ cent rapporteurs permanents. Ils comprennent cinq unités dédiées au traitement des dossiers contentieux, ainsi que le service des professions réglementées, le service des concentrations, le service des investigations et le service économique. Le service de l’économie numérique sera placé auprès du rapporteur général. Il comporte un chef de service et trois experts, qui ont le statut de rapporteur, ce qui leur permet d’exercer les pouvoirs d’instruction prévus par le code de commerce (pouvoirs d’enquête, participation à des opérations de visite et saisie notamment).
 DESCRIPTION DU POSTE

L’expert(e) en science des données sera chargé(e) de développer de nouveaux outils d’investigation fondés sur les technologies algorithmiques, les données de masse (big data) et d’intelligence artificielle à l’aide de données de type Open Source INTelligence ou collectées dans le cadre des pouvoirs d’enquête de l’Autorité[1].
Dans ces missions, l’expert(e) en science des données interviendra au soutien de l’ensemble des services d’instruction soit au travers du développement de nouveaux outils d’analyse, soit en participant directement à l’instruction de cas, en coopération avec les services antitrust ou le service des concentrations.
 Enfin, au sein du service de l’économie numérique, il(elle) assurera également des missions de nature transversale : préparation d’articles, d’études ou d’interventions liées aux problématiques de données et d’algorithmes, organisation de séminaires et de formations, dans la lignée des travaux déjà réalisés sur les données de masse, la publicité en ligne et les algorithmes[2] notamment.
Le service venant d’être créé, les missions dont il aura la charge sont très ouvertes et l’équipe sera donc une réelle force de proposition en la matière.
 Dans ce cadre, le(a) rapporteur(e) expert(e) en science des données:
conçoit et développe des outils de collecte et d’analyse de données en masse aux fins de détection de pratiques anticoncurrentielles ;
participe aux missions dévolues aux rapporteurs : enquête (recueil de preuves, audition des témoins…), opérations de visites et saisies, et en tant que de besoin instruction de cas en binôme (décisions au fond, demandes de mesures conservatoires, demandes d’avis) ;
participe aux travaux de réflexion de l’Autorité sur les problématiques numériques : recueil d’information, analyse et rédaction d’études ou avis ;
coopère avec ses homologues dans les administrations nationales ou internationales, ainsi qu’avec les milieux scientifiques et académiques ;
réalise une veille technologique sur les sujets numériques.
Il(elle) peut également être amené(e) à
développer des outils et fournir un appui aux services d’instruction sur l’analyse d’algorithmes (audit et protocoles de test) et de grands ensembles de données.

[1] A titre d’exemple, les questions posées peuvent concerner le rôle des données dans le maintien ou la conquête d’un avantage concurrentiel, l’analyse des comportements mis en œuvre pour empêcher ou amplifier la collecte de données, la collecte et l’analyse de données de prix, de quantités ou de données textuelles sur Internet, l’analyse de bases de données d’appels d’offres, l’analyse d’algorithmes de prix ou de recommandations, l’analyse automatisée de documents, etc.
[2] Etudes disponibles sur le site de l’Autorité
 PROFIL DU CANDIDAT
 Le(a) candidat(e) devra disposer d’excellentes connaissances des domaines suivants : statistiques, l’apprentissage machine (machine learning), l’extraction et l’exploitation de données  ainsi qu’une solide connaissance de la programmation (Python, R et autres langages) et des bibliothèques spécialisées. Une compréhension et une appétence pour les enjeux scientifiques et techniques de l’économie numérique est essentielle. Une expérience professionnelle pertinente en relation avec ce secteur serait un atout.
 Le(a) candidat(e) saura faire preuve d’autonomie, de sens de l’initiative. Pour autant, il(elle) saura rendre compte régulièrement de l’évolution de son travail, et contribuer à la consolidation d’une compétence et d’une culture partagée avec ses pairs. Il(elle) disposera d’un excellent relationnel ainsi qu’un goût prononcé pour le travail en mode collaboratif. Réactif(ve) et rigoureux, il(elle) témoignera d’une capacité à respecter les délais dans le traitement des affaires qui lui sont confiées.

Où est-ce que tu vas tomber ?

Au sein d’une start-up en forte croissance (moins de 10 employés début 2018, plus d’une centaine début 2020), tu évolueras au sein de l’équipe Data, Analytics & Research : une équipe composée d’une dizaine de personnes, comprenant tous les aspects de la Data : data scientists, data analysts, data architects et data engineers.

L’équipe a un double-rôle : étant au cœur du produit, elle se doit d’apporter de nouvelles propositions d’amélioration de ce dernier et doit aussi apporter des solutions de support aux autres équipes opérationnelles d’Upply sur leurs problématiques data.

Elle est adepte des philosophies suivantes :
Communication : l’équipe partage en permanence, en toute transparence et se tient au courant du travail de chacun que ce soit quotidiennement ou durant nos cérémonies hebdomadaires
Apprentissage : les idées, le code, les retours d’expérience, les erreurs, tout est une potentielle source de connaissances et sont partagés au sein de l’équipe afin d’apprendre mutuellement et de tous monter en compétence
Recherche : chez nous, les initiatives sont toujours encouragées : les erreurs apportent des connaissances, les réussites apportent de la valeur ; nous avons envie d’aller continuellement de l’avant et créer de la valeur en tentant des approches nouvelles

Qu’est-ce que tu vas faire ? 

Ton travail portera sur toute la chaîne du traitement de la donnée, en partant de la récupération et la collecte, en passant par les traitements et l’analyse descriptive pour arriver à la modélisation et la proposition d’évolutions et enfin sur la mise en production de ces nouvelles idées. Tout cela s’effectuera en équipe avec les data engineers et data scientists.

Ton rôle sera de contribuer au développement de notre pôle Analytics sur des sujets transverses à forte exposition en travaillant de manière rapprochée avec les autres départements (marketing, produit, métier, tech, etc.) afin de les aider à prendre les meilleures décisions à l’aide des données.
